Controls
	PLAYER MOVEMENT - WASD or ARROW KEYS
	POTION THROW - use left click to aim and hold down left click to charge the throw. 


WOW Factor
	I built a unique potion throwing system and spent a lot of time in milestone 1 to refine my unique 
	mechanic.
	This unique system heals knights within a certain radius of the splash zone, calculated by how long the 
	user charges the throw. 

Enemies/Interactable NPC's
	Mushroom - has two interactions, getting hurt and getting attacked. 
	Slime - has similar interactions with mushrooms, with the added challenge of slimes splitting into two 
	when initially defeated.

	All enemies drop coins that the player can pick up. These coins can be used to recruit new knights to 
	your party. 
	
	All enemies can attack the knight.

	Knights - has two interactions, attacking enemies and receiving health potions from the main character. 
	Keeping	them alive is the core to succeeding. 

Player Character
	The player is allowed to freely move within the level.
	The character is fully able to do its duty, throwing potions to the knights.
	The player holds the unique mechanic of throwing potions at the knights to heal them as they battle.

Environment
	Levels 1 and 2 use the same tile set, but level 2 offers a river that all entities can not cross without the 3 bridges available. This serves as a way to potentially change up the level through changing where entities can walk on. 

	Level 3 uses a different aesthetic, from a forest vibe to a dungeon. This is done to emphasize the boss level nature of level 3. Level 3 also introduces laser beams that knights can be attacked by, introducing a new challenge for players to overcome. It also includes some clutter items for aesthetics.

	I added background music and sound effects for clicking buttons, picking up coins, and for when bottles reach the ground to help improve the ambiance and environment.

Boss level
Has the following interactions:

	1. The player heals the knights.
	2. The knights get damaged by enemies, such as the slime and mushroom from 
		previous levels.
	3. When the initial slimes die, they split into two.
	4. The knights can get damaged by laser beams that are triggered every 5 seconds.
